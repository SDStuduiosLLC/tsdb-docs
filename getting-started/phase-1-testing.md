# ðŸ§ª Phase 1 Testing

Before continuing to further sections, it's generally a good idea to complete "Phase 1 Tests". It's basically making sure that your TSAB instance has successfuly imported all commands and listeners.

Run \`/info\` in any channel the bot has access to.

You _should_ get an ephemeral message with some info about your instance. It may also log an error - don't know what's causing that. Still looking into it.
