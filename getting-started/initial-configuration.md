# ðŸ”§ Initial Configuration

### Configuring TSAB Instance

Now that we know TSAB installed correctly, it needs to be properly configured. It's pretty easy to do - might just take a bit to get all the keys and tokens you need.

Out of the box, you should be able to find a file called config.example.ts inside the data folder. That's the one you need. Rename it to config.ts. Make sure that Git actually ignores it so you don't accidentally commit ALL of your tokens. I have made that mistake once - and never again!

There are somethings missing from the template below as they are not strictly required for your instance to operate & some preconfigured options, we recommend you keep the defaults - except for the responses, make them unique!

```typescript
export const config = {
  responses: {
    noPermission: "You do not have permission to use this command.",
    genericError:
      "Something went wrong. Hopefully the developer adds in extra info!",
    botMissingPermissionSEND_MESSAGES:
      "Missing Permissions! Please grant the bot the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission or reinvite the bot with the correct permissions.",
    botMissingPermissionEMBED_LINKS:
      "Missing Permissions! Please grant the bot the `EMBED_LINKS` permission or reinvite the bot with the correct permissions",
    botHasAdmin:
      "Woah! The server admins are treading a dangerous road, I have admin! If my token gets leaked I could cause havoc! Please ask server admins to remove my administrator permissions.\n\nI will also send a message to the log channel if there is one available.",
  },
  discord: {
    token: "",
    clientId: "",
    botPrefix:
      "" /** String of the prefix used to trigger the bot. Pinging the bot is a WIP at the moment. */,
    serverId: "",
    logChannel: "",
    staffRole: "",
    botOwners: [
      "",
    ] /** Array of all bot owners. Set index0 as the main owner/server owner, basically the person you want people to contact when it breaks. */,
    messageCommandsEnabled:
      false /** Toggle for message commands. Set to false by default for what should be obvious reasons. Read the DDev docs if you want more info on why. */,
    shardCount: 1, //make sure to use only a plain number, doing "1" will just crash it. also "auto" doesn't work for some reason
    /** Discord Permissions Int */
    permsInt: "607448176",
  },
  mongo: {
    connectionUri: "",
  },
  statcord: {
    apiKey: "",
  },
  tsabLoggerSetting: {
    /** File path of desired log file. Defaults to data/tsab.log if not specified or valid */
    logFilePath: "",
    /** Discord Webhook for sending logs to */
    loggingWebhook: "",
  },
  tsabApi: {
    /** Port that the API will run on. Defaulted to 3000 */
    apiPort: 3000,
    /** Domain the API will be accessed through. Used for callbacks and such. Default of localhost */
    domain: "localhost",
    /** Authentication key used to validate requests to protected endpoints. */
    auth: "CHANGEME!",
  },
}

```
